Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
üìã Overview
This project focuses on learning fundamental data cleaning and preprocessing techniques essential for machine learning. You'll work with raw datasets to transform them into clean, analysis-ready formats.
üéØ Objective
Learn how to clean and prepare raw data for machine learning applications through hands-on practice with real datasets.


üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

Python - Primary programming language
Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy - Numerical computing
Matplotlib/Seaborn - Data visualization

üìö Learning Guide
Step 1: Data Exploration

Import the dataset and examine its structure
Check basic information (shape, columns, data types)
Identify missing values and their patterns
Generate summary statistics

Step 2: Handle Missing Values

Understand different types of missing data (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
Apply appropriate imputation techniques:

Mean/median imputation for numerical data
Mode imputation for categorical data
Forward/backward fill for time series
Advanced methods like KNN imputation



Step 3: Categorical Data Encoding

Convert categorical features to numerical format
Choose appropriate encoding methods:

One-hot encoding for nominal data
Label encoding for ordinal data
Target encoding for high-cardinality features



Step 4: Feature Scaling

Normalize or standardize numerical features
Understand when to use each method:

Min-Max scaling (normalization)
Z-score standardization
Robust scaling for outlier-heavy data



Step 5: Outlier Detection & Treatment

Visualize outliers using boxplots and scatter plots
Apply detection methods:

Statistical methods (IQR, Z-score)
Visualization techniques


Decide on treatment: remove, cap, or transform
